# Anantra LMS Suite
Proactive Tutoring Agent as opposed to reactive chat bot

## Why Anantra
- Instead of being a reactive agent, Anantra will have a proactive agent which will run the class proactively by:
  - Continuously Assessing (interactive)
  - Filling knowlegde gaps
  - High Efficiency (completing chapter with end to end assignment)

## Multi Agentic
- Course creation agent
- Assessment agent
- Teaching Agent
- Overwatch agent : Guardrails and Checking where the course is being delayed, Will proactively make sure every one is engaged (including the student) by making. Will have access to create issues when it sees that there can be improvements to interaction (ui)/Agents or Flow

## Vision Feedback
- When the class runs (tutor/assessor) and orchestrator notices that the course is not progressing (due to knowledge gap, assessment inadaquecy etc) it will start moving the shade of the screen to a reddish border/highlight tone, which be a visual feedback for the student to focus and the agents to take a better approach to fill the gaps and to make the student understand even better
